         <h2> Interests </h2> 
        <p> My favorite thing besides coding is surfing. It may seem very different - but both give me constant challenge and intense focus. Both require creativity of testing out new approaches and analyzing possible refinements in future attempts. The result of finishing a code, or catching a wave, give the same addictive satisfaction and feels meditative to me.  </p>         
        <p>I have been pursuing music and dance throughout my lifetime, through piano and ballet, and this has become a meaningful part of my life. For me it is not only a form of expression, but a way to connect with others.  </p> 
        <p> I have now found a similar enjoyment through starting this website and learning html, css, and javascript as a way to destress from rigorous classes such as Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. It's fun to have the flexibility to plan my own format, design, and content, through a more calm form of coding. I plan on making many additions and adding more complex features in the future! </p>           
        <p> I devote myself fully to everything I am a part of. In this way I can learn the most from every experience and gain valuable intangible skills such as working with a variety of people, tackling unique challenges, deepening my understanding of concepts, keeping my creativity active with a fresh perspective on the world. I am someone who can find a strong interest in any task or project and can communicate this motivation to others. Everyday, I make an effort to live the most honest and healthy life to maintain my passion for life and create positive impacts on others. </p>
