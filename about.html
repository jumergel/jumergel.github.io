        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am an ambitious double major in mathematics and computer science at UT Austin. I seek out challenge and am open to a variety of opportunities. However, my career interests are primarily in actuarial science, statistics, and quantitative finance, but I am also very interested in machine learning, AI, and quantum physics and their future applications. </p>
        <p>Computer science is my passion and I am very excited to explore job possibilities in this field. I really enjoy it since it gives me a way to use my mathematical background to create something. I like the idea of being able of building something useful from nothing. Understanding the computer's architecture and how it all starts from on and off switches and becomes more complex has helped me further my understanding of computer science and is very fascinating to me.  </p>

        <h2> Interests </h2>
        <p> My favorite thing besides coding is surfing. It may seem very different - but both give me constant challenge and intense focus. Both require creativity of testing out new approaches and analyzing possible refinements in future attempts. The result of finishing a code, or catching a wave, give the same addictive satisfaction and feels meditative to me. 
        <p>I have been pursuing music and dance throughout my lifetime, through piano and ballet, and this has become a meaningful part of my life. For me it is not only a form of expression, but a way to connect with others.  </p>
