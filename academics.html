        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am an ambitious double major in mathematics and computer science at UT Austin. I seek out challenge and am open to a variety of opportunities. However, my career interests are primarily in actuarial science, statistics, and quantitative finance, but I am also very interested in machine learning, AI, and quantum physics and their future applications. </p>
        <p>Computer science is my passion and I am very excited to explore job possibilities in this field. I really enjoy it since it gives me a way to use my mathematical background to create something. I like the idea of being able of building something useful from nothing. Understanding the computer's architecture and how it all starts from on and off switches and becomes more complex has helped me further my understanding of computer science and is very fascinating to me.  </p>
        <p> I love life and constantly invest my time improving myself in various ways. However, I am ready to commit my time to a more serious life project and I would like to see the impact my work can make by working in industry.  </p>
